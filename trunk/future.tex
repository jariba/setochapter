% Where do we see all this going esp. in the context of embedded AI Planning
% for marine robots? This can be (and should be)
% speculative. Shore-side/onboard autonomy coordination and control of
% multiple vehicles is an important result of this activity.

% 1.6 Future Work?
% explain where EUROPA is going? (ANML, incorporation of classical planning algorithms, soft constraints, better search, etc).

% The main advantage of CP is the richness of the constraints that can be modeled and the explicit use of logical inference to prune the search space
